```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Read in Data
```{r}
scoobydoo <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-07-13/scoobydoo.csv')
```

Honestly what I want to do is pretty simple. I want to look at how many criminals each main character caught- but I want to use their pictures on the graph in the label.

Load packages
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggtext)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
x <- 
  scoobydoo %>% 
  select(season, title, date_aired,
    starts_with("caught"),
    starts_with("captured"),
    starts_with("unmask"),
    starts_with("snack"),
    -contains("other"),
    -contains("not")) %>% 
  filter(title!= "Wrestle Maniacs")
```

three_lines <- x %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c("season","title")) %>% 
  separate(name,into = c("action","character"), sep = "_") %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "action", values_from = "value")

```{r}
cleaned_scooby <- x %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c("season","title", "date_aired"), names_to = c(".value","character"), names_sep = "_") %>% 
  mutate(
    across(c("caught","captured","unmask","snack"), ~as.logical(.x) %>% as.integer()) 
  ) %>% 
  na.omit()

```

Group by character and sum up how many criminals each caught
```{r}
criminal_catches <- cleaned_scooby %>% 
  group_by(character) %>% 
  summarise(caught_criminals = sum(caught))
```
Create images as labels
```{r}
labels = c(
  shaggy = "<img src='shaggy.png' width='40' /><br>",
  scooby = "<img src='scooby.png' width='40' /><br>",
  fred = "<img src='fred.png' width='40' /><br>",
  daphnie = "<img src='daphne.jpg' width='40' /><br>",
  velma = "<img src='velma.png' width='40' /><br>"
)
```
Graph Results, and try and get pictures for axis labels
```{r}
ggplot(criminal_catches, aes(character,caught_criminals))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = '#79AF30')+
  theme_dark()+
  labs(title = "Who caught the most criminals? It's Scooby's world and we are all just living in it!", y = 'Criminals Caught', caption = 'Source:  https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman/scoobydoo-complete')+
  scale_x_discrete(name = NULL,labels = labels) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_markdown())

ggsave('ScoobyCriminals.png')


```
